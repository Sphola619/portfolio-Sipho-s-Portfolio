    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/Sipho.JPG" alt="Sipho Profile Image" class="about-img">
    <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Sipho! I‚Äôm a Front-End Developer passionate about crafting clean, responsive, scalable and visually engaging websites. I enjoy turning ideas into intuitive user experiences through modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with React as my go-to framework.</p>
    <p>I bring a detail-oriented mindset, a strong eye for design, and a problem-solving approach to every project I work on. Whether it‚Äôs building pixel-perfect layouts, optimizing performance, or making applications accessible and mobile-friendly, I strive to deliver solutions that not only work but feel great to use. I‚Äôm also eager to keep learning, exploring new tools and best practices to grow as a developer and add value to every team or project I join.</p>
  
    <h3>My Journey</h3>
  
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="year">
        <h4>üéì 2022 ‚Äì University of Fort Hare</h4>
        <p>In 2022, I graduated with an Honours Degree in Financial Markets from the University of Fort Hare. Through this program, I developed a strong understanding of global financial systems, investment principles, risk management, and the mechanics of trading. I particularly enjoyed learning about how data and technology play a key role in modern finance ‚Äî something that later sparked my transition into tech.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="year">
        <h4>üíº 2023 ‚Äì Bidvest Bank Graduate Program</h4>
        <p>In 2023, I joined the Bidvest Bank Graduate Program, where I worked in the Treasury Department. This experience gave me hands-on exposure to the money markets, liquidity management, risk management and foreign exchange operations. I discovered how critical precision, data accuracy, and system reliability are in high-stakes financial environments. It also opened my eyes to how much backend systems and automation drive financial efficiency ‚Äî further strengthening my interest in information technology.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="year">
        <h4>üìú 2024 ‚Äì ACI Dealing Certificate</h4>
        <p>In 2024, I earned my ACI Dealing Certificate, a globally recognized qualification for professionals in the financial markets. The program deepened my knowledge of money market instruments, foreign exchange, and risk management, while emphasizing ethical and efficient dealing practices. This certification refined my analytical mindset and reinforced my commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="year">
        <h4>üíª 2024 ‚Äì Transition to Tech</h4>
        <p>Despite my finance background, I‚Äôve always been passionate about technology and problem-solving. In 2024, I decided to formally pursue this interest following the conclusion of the Bidvest Bank Graduate Program by enrolling in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with HyperionDev. During the bootcamp, I built real-world projects using JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB ‚Äî gaining a solid understanding of both frontend and backend development. It was here that I realized how much I enjoyed bringing digital ideas to life through code.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="year">
        <h4>üöÄ 2024 ‚Äì Continued Learning</h4>
        <p>After completing the bootcamp, I continued refining my skills using online platforms like FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. These resources helped me strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, improve my understanding of web performance, and sharpen my problem-solving through coding challenges. I also explored deployment, version control, and responsive design to prepare for professional work.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="year">
        <h4>üë®‚Äçüíª 2025 ‚Äì Marome Investments</h4>
        <p>In November 2024, I began working as a Junior Front-End Software Developer at Marome Investments, a backend solutions freelance company. My role involves building and maintaining responsive user interfaces, optimizing client-side performance, and collaborating with backend developers to ensure seamless API integration. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to contribute to live projects, improve UI consistency, and develop reusable components ‚Äî all while continuing to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  
    <p>
      Looking ahead, my goal is to keep building high-quality websites and applications that help businesses grow and stand out online. I enjoy working closely with clients to understand their vision and translate it into clean, responsive, and user-friendly designs. Every project gives me the chance to improve my skills and learn something new ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs improving performance, refining UI details, or experimenting with modern frameworks. I‚Äôm passionate about creating digital experiences that not only look great but also deliver real value to users and clients.
